and also carrying other key vacancies My ability to support him as well as I would have liked was inhibited by other circumstances On top of this he inherited a situation that has led to major contractual dispute which was only recently settled He has therefore been distracted from the normal running of the prison All of this has however helped to accelerate him through the psychological process of transition from to a totally different culture and operating context He has shown great flexibility and resilience in taking this in his stride although I suspect there has been more angst than he has shown This year he has consolidated the process of two?way assimilation he to the organisation and the organisation to him He has a great deal to offer and a great deal to receive from
