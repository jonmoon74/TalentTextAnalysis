This is a simple pandas/python3 programme to analyse the content of the strengths, development areas and development plans from Talent review outputs.
All data is stripped of identifying characteristics and the script produces word analysis and frequency tables based on pre-defined talent keyword, unique words and the top fifty occurring words
